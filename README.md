# Unsolved problems/Major hurdles I had to over come:

- Unsolved problem was being able to add player name mainly due to poor time managment and not getting ahead of it in time.
- Ran into some probelms with functions for changing the color to green/red if its correct/incorrect. I was able to however go to office hours and figure it out.
- Time management was definitely something I took lightly and I was humbled. Going forth will be focusing on MVP and give myself deadlines.
